Developer
	Ahmet Timur Selcuk Dundar
		I am Ahmet and from Turkey, Istanbul. I get too much from open source community and want to give some of my work back to community to make it fair trade. I worked 9 years for Turkey's biggest bank (Turkey Isbank) as a software developer. And working as a freelancer 2 years at time i am writing this. 
		:I love javascript. I love creating new framework(s) and see them in action. So please share your exprience with my h5Engine even its a bad one. @mailto:atsd34@gmail.com@ 
		I want to continue to work on h5Game Engine as long as there is time for it. So dont hesitate to ask for new features bug reports on my GITHUB it really helps. And if you want to contribute contact me. Also you can always donate me money so i can keep working on this and spare more time for h5Engine. 
		NOTE : I created this h5engine for myself to use for my needs. And used in some games. Then wanted to share my work with others. But still this is very early version so dont let missing features and bugs (If there any) discourage you. You may easily fix it or contact me.
		If you want to donate bitcoins here is my address, please note feature request with donations are welcomed.
