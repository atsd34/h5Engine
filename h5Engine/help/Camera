Camera
	Game Camera
		Every object in h5Engine is stored in "objects" object there is one exception for this ; Camera. You can access camera with "camera" object. Camera controls where gameview look at all objects are drawn relative to camera.
		You cannot set camera from gameview camera related actions must be done in simple coding.
	Coding
		"camera" object have following properties.
		x,y : This is where camera's lookAt position. Any object that is at the same position as camera x-y will be centered.
		function camera.follow(go,percent) : With this easy function you can make a camera to stick to a gameobject, that gameobject always will be locked to center. With second parameter you can add easing effect. At 100 camera will follow immediately at 5 (for example) camera always tries to catch up to gameobject.
		camera.followX , camera.followY : with this boolean variables you can toggle following X or following Y positions. When camera.followX ==false and camera.followY ==true , then camera will follow Y position but not X position , X position must be set manually.
		//Example 
		camera.x= 200; // now camera's center position is set to x=200 - for easy reference think an object with x position =200 that object will be centered.
		camera.follow(objects.GameObject0,20); // now camera's x and y values will be calculated automatically to follow GameObject0.
		camera.followY=false; // Dont follow GameObject0's y value.
		camera.y=-100; // now camera's center position's y value is set to static -100. camera's x position will always follow GameObject0 whereas camera y position will always be -100;
