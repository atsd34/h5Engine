Particle System
		To add particle system, add "particle" component to gameobject then configure with your needs.
		maxLife: Every particle have their own life set with this value when they created.
		minSpeed: Minimum speed of a particle.
		maxSpeed: Maximum speed of a particle.
		velocityX : Starting horizantal velocity of particle (can be negative)
		velocityY : Starting vertical velocity of particle (can be negative)
		velocityRandomness : velocityX and Y can be varied with random value with this. This way every particle will have different velocity.
		startSize : Size of a particle hen it is spawned.
		endSize : Estimated size of a particle when its life is over (destroyed)
		minRotation : Every particle rotates with their velocity you can limit it with this.
		maxRotation : Every particle rotates with their velocity you can limit it with this.
		maxRotationRandomness : Every particle can have different amount of rotation within random value set by this.
		maxParticle: MAximum number of particles allowed. When Current particle count hits this number new particles arent spawned until some of the particles destroyed (Through life)
		particleSpawnSpeed : Number of particles spawned can be set with this.
		tintByLife : Particles can change its color throuhout its life-cycle you can set an array of colors here.
		path : Particle's image path.
		AnimationSpeed : If particle image is an paperbook animation this value sets its animation speed (Yes particles can be animated.)
